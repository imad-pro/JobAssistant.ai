#### Description:

As part of my CS50 milestone project, I created an AI tool to support job seekers in their interview preparation.

The project combines my business background, mentorship expertise, technical skills in Python (Flask) and JavaScript (Express.js), and prompt engineering techniques.

The app is smartly developed to provide a user experience similar to 1:1 coaching.
Simply input the "job description" and "resume" and let the magic happen. The app will generate a personalized interview preparation guide specific to your expertise and the job you're applying for:
 1- Self-presentation
 2- Company challenges & candidate as a solution: Potential company
 challenges and how to position yourself as the solution.
 3-Tailored Questions & Answers: Five relevant interview questions based
 on your profile and job description, with detailed answers.
 4-Your turn to ask questions: Guidance on asking meaningful questions
 to show your engagement and understanding.
 5-Key Strategies: Practical advice to impress your interviewer.

With the built-in prompts and instructions, the content provided will be similar to a personal coach rather than a chatbot.

Project Overview:
 • Flask framework and g4f open-source library from GitHub for a local
 GPT-4 API.
 • Main app backend code built with Express.js.
 • Frontend designed with EJS.
 • API communication through Axios.
